# Predictive Analytics for Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)
 E-Commerce Sector

---

## Objective of the Project
The primary objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that estimates the lifetime value of a customer based on their purchasing history, browsing behavior, and other relevant factors. This model aims to assist e-commerce companies in tailoring their marketing strategies and personalizing the customer experience effectively.

## What the Project Does
This project leverages predictive modelling, customer segmentation, and machine learning techniques to analyze the "Online Retail II" dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It includes the following steps:
1. Data Preprocessing and Cleaning
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) Analysis
4. Customer Segmentation
5. Predictive Modeling using BetaGeoFitter and GammaGammaFitter
6. CLTV (Customer Lifetime Value) Prediction
7. Visualization of Results

## Why the Project is Useful
This project is beneficial for businesses seeking to enhance their customer relationship management strategies. By predicting the CLTV, companies can identify high-value customers and allocate their marketing resources more effectively. This targeted approach can lead to increased customer retention, higher sales, and improved overall profitability.

## Important Results of the Project
- Identified key customer segments such as 'Champions', 'Loyal', 'At Risk', etc.
- Estimated the future transaction values and frequency for each customer.
- Predicted the monetary value for future transactions on an individual customer basis.
- Segmented customers based on their predicted lifetime value.

## Key Insights from the Project
- Customer segmentation based on RFM analysis provides deep insights into customer behaviour.
- The lifetime value of a customer is a critical metric for making informed marketing and sales decisions.
- Predictive analytics can effectively forecast customer behaviour, helping in personalized marketing efforts.
